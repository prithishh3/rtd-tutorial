===================================

**REST** is a Java GUI application package for generating realistic cosmic dust structures.
It uses the following algorithms :
* This is a bulleted list.
* It has two items, the second
  item uses two lines. (note the indentation)

1. Strongly Damaged Sphere (SDS)
2. Rough Surface (RS)
3. Poked Structure (PS)
4. Rough Surface Super-ellipsoid (RS-SE)
5. Poked Structure Super-ellipsoid (PS-SE)
6. Rough Fractal Aggregates (RFA)

#. This is a numbered list.
#. It has two items too.

It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.
